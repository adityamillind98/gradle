[[upgrading_version_8]]
= Upgrading your build from Gradle 8.x to the latest

This chapter provides the information you need to migrate your Gradle 8.x builds to the latest Gradle release.
For migrating from Gradle 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, or 7.x, see the <<upgrading_version_7.adoc#upgrading_version_7, older migration guide>> first.

We recommend the following steps for all users:

. Try running `gradle help --scan` and view the https://gradle.com/enterprise/releases/2018.4/#identify-usages-of-deprecated-gradle-functionality[deprecations view] of the generated build scan.
+
image::deprecations.png[Deprecations View of a Gradle Build Scan]
+
This is so you can see any deprecation warnings that apply to your build.
+
Alternatively, you could run `gradle help --warning-mode=all` to see the deprecations in the console, though it may not report as much detailed information.
. Update your plugins.
+
Some plugins will break with this new version of Gradle, for example because they use internal APIs that have been removed or changed.
The previous step will help you identify potential problems by issuing deprecation warnings when a plugin does try to use a deprecated part of the API.
+
. Run `gradle wrapper --gradle-version {gradleVersion}` to update the project to {gradleVersion}.
. Try to run the project and debug any errors using the <<troubleshooting.adoc#troubleshooting, Troubleshooting Guide>>.

[[changes_8.1]]
== Upgrading from 8.0 and earlier

=== Potential breaking changes

=== Deprecations

[[custom_configuration_roles]]
==== Custom configuration roles

// TODO: There is currently no API for users to provide "custom roles" or even
// any roles at all other than the existing role-mutating methods. We should revisit
// this deprecation log and section when we introduce a public API for creating
// locked-role configurations.

Custom roles have been deprecated.
Use a pre-defined role instead.

[[configurations_allowed_usage]]
==== Allowed configurations usage

The usage of configurations should be fixed at creation.
Mutating the allowed usage on a configuration is deprecated.
This includes calling any of the following `Configuration` methods:

- `setCanBeConsumed(boolean)`
- `setCanBeResolved(boolean)`

The ability to change the allowed usage of a configuration after creation will be removed in Gradle 9.0.

[[java_extension_without_java_component]]
==== Calling select methods on the `JavaPluginExtension` without the `java` component present

Starting in Gradle 8.1, calling any of the following methods on `JavaPluginExtension` without
the presence of the default `java` component is deprecated:

- `withJavadocJar()`
- `withSourcesJar()`
- `consistentResolution(Action)`

This `java` component is added by the `JavaPlugin`, which is applied by any of the Gradle JVM plugins including:

- `java-library`
- `application`
- `groovy`
- `scala`

Starting in Gradle 9.0, calling any of the above listed methods without the presence of the default `java` component
will become an error.

[[war_plugin_configure_configurations]]
==== `WarPlugin#configureConfiguration(ConfigurationContainer)`

Starting in Gradle 8.1, calling `WarPlugin#configureConfiguration(ConfigurationContainer)` is deprecated. This method was
intended for internal use and was never intended to be used as part of the public interface.

Starting in Gradle 9.0, this method will be removed without replacement.

[[gmm_modification_after_publication_populated]]
==== Modifying Gradle Module Metadata after a publication has been populated

Altering the link:publishing_gradle_module_metadata.html[GMM] (e.g., changing a component configuration variants) *after* a Maven or Ivy publication has been populated from their components is now deprecated.
This feature will be removed in Gradle 9.0.

Eager population of the publication can happen if the following methods are called:

* Maven
** link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/publish/maven/MavenPublication.html#getArtifacts--[MavenPublication.getArtifacts()]
* Ivy
** link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/publish/ivy/IvyPublication.html#getArtifacts--[IvyPublication.getArtifacts()]
** link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/publish/ivy/IvyPublication.html#getConfigurations--[IvyPublication.getConfigurations()]
** link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/publish/ivy/IvyPublication.html#configurations(Action)--[IvyPublication.configurations(Action)]

Previously, the following code did not generate warnings, but it created inconsistencies between published artifacts:

====
[.multi-language-sample]
=====
.build.gradle.kts
[source,kotlin]
----
publishing {
    publications {
        create<MavenPublication>("maven") {
            from(components["java"])
        }
        create<IvyPublication>("ivy") {
            from(components["java"])
        }
    }
}

// These calls eagerly populate the Maven and Ivy publications

(publishing.publications["maven"] as MavenPublication).artifacts
(publishing.publications["ivy"] as IvyPublication).artifacts

val javaComponent = components["java"] as AdhocComponentWithVariants
javaComponent.withVariantsFromConfiguration(configurations["apiElements"]) { skip() }
javaComponent.withVariantsFromConfiguration(configurations["runtimeElements"]) { skip() }
----
=====
[.multi-language-sample]
=====
.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
publishing {
    publications {
        maven(MavenPublication) {
            from components.java
        }
        ivy(IvyPublication) {
            from components.java
        }
    }
}

// These calls eagerly populate the Maven and Ivy publications

publishing.publications.maven.artifacts
publishing.publications.ivy.artifacts

components.java.withVariantsFromConfiguration(configurations.apiElements) { skip() }
components.java.withVariantsFromConfiguration(configurations.runtimeElements) { skip() }
----
=====
====

In this example, the Maven and Ivy publications will contain the main JAR artifacts for the project, whereas the GMM link:https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/master/subprojects/docs/src/docs/design/gradle-module-metadata-latest-specification.md[module file] will omit them.

[[minimum_test_jvm_version]]
==== Running tests on JVM versions 6 and 7

Running JVM tests on JVM versions older than 8 is deprecated.
Testing on these versions will become an error in Gradle 9.0

[[kotlin_dsl_precompiled_gradle_lt_6]]
==== Applying Kotlin DSL precompiled scripts published with Gradle < 6.0

Applying Kotlin DSL precompiled scripts published with Gradle < 6.0 is deprecated.
Please use a version of the plugin published with Gradle >= 6.0.

[[kotlin_dsl_with_kgp_lt_1_8_0]]
==== Applying the `kotlin-dsl` together with Kotlin Gradle Plugin < 1.8.0

Applying the `kotlin-dsl` together with Kotlin Gradle Plugin < 1.8.0 is deprecated.
Please let Gradle control the version of `kotlin-dsl` by removing any explicit `kotlin-dsl` version constraints from your build logic.
This will let the `kotlin-dsl` plugin decide which version of the Kotlin Gradle Plugin to use.
If you explicitly declare which version of the Kotlin Gradle Plugin to use for your build logic, update it to >= 1.8.0.

[[validate_plugins_without_java_toolchain]]
==== Using `ValidatePlugins` task without a Java Toolchain

Using a task of type link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/plugin/devel/tasks/ValidatePlugins.html[ValidatePlugins] without applying the link:https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/toolchains.html[Java Toolchains] plugin is deprecated, and will become an error in Gradle 9.0.

To avoid this warning, please apply the plugin to your project:

====
[.multi-language-sample]
=====
.build.gradle.kts
[source,kotlin]
----
plugins {
    id("jdk-toolchains")
}
----
=====
[.multi-language-sample]
=====
.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
plugins {
    id 'jdk-toolchains'
}
----
=====
====

The Java Toolchains plugin is applied automatically by the link:https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_plugin.html[Java plugin],
so you can also apply it to your project and it will fix the warning.

[[org_gradle_util_reports_deprecations]]
==== Deprecated members of the `org.gradle.util` package now report their deprecation

These members will be removed in Gradle 9.0.

* `VersionNumber`
* `WrapUtil.toDomainObjectSet(...)`
* `GUtil.toCamelCase(...)`
* `GUtil.toLowerCase(...)`
* `ConfigureUtil.configureByMap(...)`
