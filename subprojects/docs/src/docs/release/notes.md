## Upgrade instructions

Switch your build to use Gradle @version@ by updating your wrapper:

`./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version=@version@`

See the [Gradle 7.x upgrade guide](userguide/upgrading_version_7.html#changes_@baseVersion@) to learn about deprecations, breaking changes and other considerations when upgrading to Gradle @version@.

For Java, Groovy, Kotlin and Android compatibility, see the [full compatibility notes](userguide/compatibility.html).

## New features, performance and usability improvements

<!-- Do not add breaking changes or deprecations here! Add them to the upgrade guide instead. -->

### Gradle Wrapper

#### Introduced labels for selecting the version

The [`--gradle-version`](userguide/gradle_wrapper.html#sec:adding_wrapper) parameter for the wrapper plugin
now supports using predefined labels to select a version.

The allowed labels are:

- `latest`
- `release-candidate`
- `nightly`
- `release-nightly`

More details can be found in the [Gradle Wrapper](userguide/gradle_wrapper.html#sec:adding_wrapper) section.

### FILL-IN-KEY-AREA improvements

<<<FILL IN CONTEXT FOR KEY AREA>>>
Example:
> The [configuration cache](userguide/configuration_cache.html) improves build performance by caching the result of
> the configuration phase. Using the configuration cache, Gradle can skip the configuration phase entirely when
> nothing that affects the build configuration has changed.

#### FILL-IN-FEATURE
> HIGHLIGHT the usecase or existing problem the feature solves
> EXPLAIN how the new release addresses that problem or use case
> PROVIDE a screenshot or snippet illustrating the new feature, if applicable
> LINK to the full documentation for more details
